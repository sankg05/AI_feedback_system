Three prompting approaches were implemented and evaluated:
1. Zero-shot prompting
2. Few-shot prompting
3. Chain-of-thought prompting with enforced JSON output
All experiments were conducted on a sampled subset of the Yelp Reviews dataset.

The CSV files for the outputs of each prompting approach have been appended in this directory.
